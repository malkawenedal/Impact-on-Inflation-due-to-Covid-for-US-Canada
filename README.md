## Message 
Define the core message or hypothesis of the project.
The purpose of this project is to determine and analyze Covid 19 statistics and find correlation with the inflation of
the headline consumer index for US and Canada 
Quantitative analysis methods from Python and Pandas shall be in use for assessing various data sets regarding different Canada and the US with the Headline Consumer index of each country. 

## Requirements
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate data exploration, cleanup , data analysis based on certain questions,
and to engage in visualization using the libraries: PyViz, Panel, PlotExpress, and Hvplot. An additional library is also required
and we chose the library Pygal for additional visualization (bar charts)

Each question & Answer

## Approach
The coding actions include reading and cleaning csv data, visualization, plotting using hvplot, seaborn, plotly, panel, pyviz and pygal
Our team gathered covid cases easily from (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data9)
We had covid info from World Bank
Our US information was collected into a CSV file and cleaned (https://www.rateinflation.com/inflation-rate/usa-historical-inflation-rate/)
We noticed that there was lacking 2022 data and some missing 2021 data, so we decided to not do any 2022 analysis
fill in 2021 data from another source. First was to clean the covid cases csv file, and collapse / aggregate Canada and US 
by monthly for analysis. Then Inflation rates for 2021 were cleaned by removing the years before 2019. 
We used help from this source : https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/building-visualizations-with-pygal 

The refined and constructed information shall yield the average covid cases per month, rolling standard standard deviations, averages
and a mean.
 
   Questions: 
   Is there a correlation between rise in covid cases and the headline consumer index for the US and Canada?
   (heatmap, parrallel coordinates, twin plot, plotly)
   
   What is the mean of the inflation of canada and us?
   Is there correlation between US and Canada inflation?
   What is the average covid cases per month for USA and Canada?
   What is the STD of each data set? What will it look like plotted? Can these be plotted in a proper scale?
   What will inflation and cases look like plotted?
   What does total covid cases and inflation rate look like on a aggregate chart?
   
  
These questions were asked because of the noticeable price increases the past few years of many categories including consumer, food, and real estate prices.
